Hi there! This weekend I hacked together a little tool to convert local paths to UNC or samba links you can share with your buddies on LAN. Mostly so I have something to blog about, but it may just as well make my life easier ;)

You can grab it from [github](https://github.com/cician/SambaLinkMaker). Note that there is at least one such program for Windows already, I use Linux so I made it Windows/Linux cross platform.
